File Renaming Script
This repository contains a Linux script designed to rename files in a directory, replacing dashes (-) with underscores (_). This script is useful for standardizing file names, especially in environments where consistency and clarity are important.

Features
Replaces all dashes with underscores in file names.
Checks for conflicts if the new names match existing files.
Flexible to work with any specified directory.
Easy to use and customize for different scenarios.
Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Grant execution permissions to the script:

    chmod +x rename_files.sh

2. Run the script, passing the directory path where you want to rename files:

    ./rename_files.sh /path/to/directory

The script will rename all files in the specified directory, keeping the existing structure, and avoiding name conflicts.
